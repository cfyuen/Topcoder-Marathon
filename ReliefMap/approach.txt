- ask points in 2 contour lines, if the same, ask until different (take a line as basic, take two side to ask)
- ask the same point 2 times (or more) and take average
- calculate quite accurate D and calculate all contour line points

- ask all (may not be all) extreme point, and determine whether it is the highest or lowest point
(1) find average between 2 nearest contour line and return result


*1* ask all extreme point until find 0, floodfill the side to find D (ask several point on the line and take average)
*2* calculate all contour line
*3* for each contour line, floodfill, if find no black point (contour line or point), measure middle point


improvements:
- get estimate of D first round, deeply investigate second round (be careful of round top)
- if no point find, random find point near contour (or center of circle)
- if distance(last mp,now mp) < thereshold, no measure
- for a point, use top/bottom point realationship (when there is no contour line nearby)
	if that point is close to many contour lines, weight is higher
	use distance and weight to estimate a point

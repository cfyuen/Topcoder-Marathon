run some spy.login()
for each spy.login()
   log all image
   if empty, do nothing
   if something and cnt not exceed m
         add 1 to that image
         (add some to other image nearby?)
   if something and cnt exceed m
         if point outside convex hull
		this image=max+1
   check all previous state
         if not fit, all possible image near point +
	 if fit, all now image +


convex hull = always updated (take top m, or try all combination within m+c)
